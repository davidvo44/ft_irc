- rethink project structure
	use one container format accross all project (map or mutant)

- rename variables with EXPLICIT variable names
- refactor functions

- fix ProtocolError output : for KICK, format is <nick> <client> <channel> but it's not an option yet
	use DEFINES for error formating (source ihabiby)

- rework commands parsing (have format for basic commands, and custom parsing for more complex commands)

- fix WHO :
	new client that joins channel is not aware of others clients already in channel

- fix JOIN : /join #1 #2 #3  mdp passwd mo2pass
password for each channel:   #1    #2     #3

- add KICK multiple users : /kick user1, user2, user3 <reasonForKick>
	output has to be :	<operator> has kicked user1 from <channel> (reasonForKick)
						<operator> has kicked user2 from <channel> (reasonForKick)
						<operator> has kicked user3 from <channel> (reasonForKick)

- make whitelist for INVITE (Channels will contain both a clientList and invitedClientList (AKA the whitelist))
